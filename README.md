# bKash Webhook Notifications API Documentation

## Overview

The **bKash Webhook Notifications API** allows merchants to seamlessly receive real-time updates regarding bKash transactions. With this API, merchants are notified of key events such as payment completions and subscription confirmations, ensuring that they stay informed of important actions on their accounts.

---

## Base URL

The base URL for the bKash Webhook Notifications API is:

```
https://shunnoit.top/shunno-payment/api/v1
```

This is the endpoint to which all webhook notifications are sent, and it should be configured in the merchant's system.

---

## Events

The bKash Webhook Notifications API provides notifications for two main events:

1. **Subscription Confirmation**
2. **Payment Notification**

Each event will trigger a corresponding HTTP POST request to the webhook URL, delivering important information about the event.

---

When the merchant subscribes to receive notifications, bKash will send a **Subscription Confirmation** payload. This payload contains a `SubscribeURL` that must be visited in order to confirm the subscription.
